RE notes about the bluetooth chip inside Learn With Pokémon: Typing Adventure. Hopefully soon to become a savedata manager.

~~Homebrew for dumping and restoring savegames for Learn With Pokémon: Typing Adventure. Additionally you can dump the content of the flash chip inside the cartridge, or test the bluetooth chip.~~

~~Requires SD card access; tested on 3DS with [TWiLightMenu](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu) (DSi should work fine).~~

## Thanks
